We are pleased to announce the second beta release of our "remake" of
HaskellDB, version 0.9.
HaskellDB is available for download from http://haskelldb.sourceforge.net

HaskellDB is a Haskell library for expressing database queries and
operations in a type safe and declarative way. HaskellDB compiles a
relational algebra-like syntax into SQL, submits the operations to the
database for processing, and returns the results as ordinary Haskell
values.

The original version of HaskellDB was written by Daan Leijen and is
available at http://www.haskell.org/haskellDB/. The implementation is 
based on his paper which can be found at:  
http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/daan/download/papers/dsec.ps

New in HaskellDB 0.9:
- HaskellDB is no longer an auto-package, since this would turn on
  glasgow-exts even for programs that don't use HaskellDB.
- Fixed various character escaping issues. There are still some
  problems with escaping for SQLite.
- Exposed dbInfoToModuleFiles for creating database description
  modules from a DBInfo.
- Added <<- operator to make creating constant records for insert
  easier.
- Added _length query operator for getting the length of a string.
- Made record implementation more general.
- Lots of smaller fixes to code and documentation.

The developers can be reached at haskelldb-users@lists.sourceforge.net or
on #haskelldb at irc.freenode.net.
