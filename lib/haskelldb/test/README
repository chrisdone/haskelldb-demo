To run these tests, make sure haskelldb is installed with the database
driver you want to use. Then, in the test/ directory:

  ghc --make DescDB1.hs
  ./DescDB1 
  ghc --make RunTests.hs

To test against postgres, using HDBC, first update 
test-hdbc-postgresql.hs with appropriate login information. Then:

  ghc --make test-hdbc-postgresql.hs
  ./test-hdbc-postgresql
  
And similarly for the other database and driver combinations.
